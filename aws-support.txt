I'm able to deploy a Django application just fine using this tutorial:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-django.html

... however, if I upgrade Django from 2.1.1 to 2.2.3 in the requirements.txt file & deploy to AWS I get a 500 error and this message show up in the logs:

mod_wsgi (pid=3748): Target WSGI script '/opt/python/current/app/config/wsgi.py' cannot be loaded as Python module.
mod_wsgi (pid=3748): Exception occurred processing WSGI script '/opt/python/current/app/config/wsgi.py'.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/python/current/app/config/wsgi.py", line 16, in <module>
    application = get_wsgi_application()
  File "/opt/python/run/venv/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/django/core/wsgi.py", line 12, in 
    get_wsgi_application
    django.setup(set_prefix=False)

    raise RuntimeError("populate() isn't reentrant")
    RuntimeError: populate() isn't reentrant

I've ssh'd into the instance to check the version of Python:

$ python --version
Python 2.7.16

$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.8

Things I've tried/checked after upgrading Django to 2.2.3:

1. Everything runs fine on 127.0.0.1:8000
2. $ python3 manage.py check shows 0 errors
3. .elasticbeanstalk/rns-env.env.yml:

  ...
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
    NumProcesses: '1'
    NumThreads: '15'
    StaticFiles: /static/=static/
    WSGIPath: config/wsgi.py
  ...

4. .ebextensions/django.config:

  option_settings:
    aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:
      WSGIPath: config/wsgi.py

Has anyone else had any issues upgrading Django? Downgrading to Django 2.1.1 (or 2.1.10) removes the problem but it'd be nice to run the latest version. Thanks.
